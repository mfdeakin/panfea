Requires a configuration file
Simulates thermal diffusion between two different mediums (brownie and a metal pan)
Requires a configuration file with the following format:

Number of divisions along the length
Number of divisions along the width
Length of the pan
Width of the pan
Number of seconds in a timestep
Temperature of the air (K)
Temperature of the pan (K)
Initial temperature of the brownies
Total mass of the brownies
Thermal Contact resistance of the brownies to the metal
Diffusivity of the brownies
Diffusivity of the pan
Then the pan configuration itself. For good results, the outer edge must be pan.
